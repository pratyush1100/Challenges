## Why This Repo Is Created

I'm focusing on practicing my skills by attempting projects on some famous sites (mentioned above). They asked for the source code for the solutions, and for that purpose I was forced to create separate repositories for each project. The amount of projects would have become very much and so the repositories, so i decided to make a repository which contains all the solutions well organized with a readme file to know about the solution.

## Hosting

I'll use [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) or [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) for hosting static page websites.
